## [1.11] - 2021-11-10 

### Added
- An input handler class was added to modify the incoming data(Request body, parameters and headers).
- Adding BBj unit test classes to validate the GET, POST and PUT requests.
- Adding a unit test setup class that creates a new RestBridge mapping for all tests.
- Adding a Postman collection to demonstrate the structure and also to test the HTTP requests(Currently it only contains the DELETE requests).

### Changed
- When invoking GET requests, the RestBridge will now always invoke the requested BC's setScope(), setFieldSelection() and setFilter() methods.
- Invalid PUT and DELETE requests now result in a 400(BAD REQUEST).
- Invalid paging(_OFFSET, _LIMIT, _PAGE,_PER_PAGE) requests now result in a 400(BAD REQUEST).
- When attempting to invoke a custom BC method with invalid parameters and error 400(BAD REQUEST) is returned.
- Attempting to invoke a non existing BC results in a 404(NOT FOUND).
- When performing a lookup request, by default the BusinessComponent's getLookupData() method will be invoked, using the retrieveLookup() as a fallback. The retrieveLookup() method is not defined in the BusinessComponent interface, and will likely be removed in future versions(#30)
- DELETE Request don't need to have a body when using the correct trailing routes
- The RestBridge attempts to invoke the write(ResultSet) / remove(ResultSet) for the POST, PUT and DELETE requests and falls back to the write(DataRow) / remove(DataRow) methods if they do not exist
- Replacing the auth0jwt.jar usage with the nimbus.jar shipped with BBj(#32 & #38)
